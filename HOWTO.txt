 Create UEFI linux executable that boots from zfs filesystem, from dataset zpool_ssd/rootfs_ubuntu1604:
	./create-linux-uefi-boot.sh /boot/vmlinuz-4.4.0-64-generic /boot/initrd.img-4.4.0-64-generic "root=ZFS=zpool_ssd/rootfs_ubuntu1604 boot=zfs" /tmp/bootx64.efi
	# copy the /tmp/bootx64.efi file to the efi partition, to /boot/efi/bootx64.efi

    For best practice to boot linux's rootfilesystem from zfs, the drive should be partitioned as follow:
    
    1.  efi partiion (200mb).  This is also known as a vfat partition, but the partition type is uefi.
    1.  ext boot partiion (200mb).  This partition is needed if you can to boot in CMS, also known as MBR boot.
									Typically, this partition is flaged as active boot.   
    2.  solaris partition (full drive) - this is a zfs zpool, ie) zpool_ssd.  Under this partition there
										 should exist a dataset called rootfs.

	By following the above convention, linux can be booted on a usb drive on any x86 machines.  
	The beauty is that zfs dataset can be updated or repair if it gets corrupted, a problem that can
	not easily be fixed if rootfs is run on ext3/4.



 Enjoy!
